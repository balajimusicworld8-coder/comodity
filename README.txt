Mahadev Fabric Care - Starter React project
------------------------------------------

Files included:
- package.json
- public/index.html
- src/main.jsx
- src/App.jsx
- src/index.css

How to run:
1. Install Node.js if not already installed.
2. In the project folder run:
   npm install
   npm run dev
3. Open the local URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes:
- The account system uses localStorage to mock user creation and login (for prototyping only).
- To deploy for real customers you'll need a backend (Node/Express, database) and proper authentication.
- Replace gallery placeholder boxes with real images (add images into public or load via URL).
- The UI uses simple CSS and Framer Motion for light animations.
